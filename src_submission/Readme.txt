This file explains the structure of the project. The files can be divided into three categories, 
namely baseline algortihms, novel solutions, data handler files.

basline algorithms:
- average_over_items.ipynb
- average_over_users.ipynb
- SVD_basic.ipynb
- ALS.ipynb
- KNN_basic.ipynb
- NMF.ipynb

novel solutions:
- SVD_improved.ipynb
- Deep_collaborative_filtering directoy

data handler files:
- data_handler.py
- surprise_extensions.py
